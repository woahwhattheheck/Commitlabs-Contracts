# Commitment Marketplace Contract

This page documents the public entry points, access control, and security notes for the `commitment_marketplace` Soroban contract. It is intended for integrators and auditors.

## Security
- All state-changing entry points require authentication (`require_auth`) for the relevant actor, except `end_auction` (which is time-gated).
- Reentrancy guard is enforced on all entry points that mutate state and/or make external calls.
- Arithmetic is performed using checked math; integer division truncates toward zero.
- No cross-contract NFT ownership checks or transfers are performed in this implementation (see contract comments).
- All token transfers use Soroban token interface.

## Reentrancy Guard
- All mutating entry points set/check/clear a `ReentrancyGuard` storage key.
- If the guard is set, the contract returns `MarketplaceError::ReentrancyDetected`.
- See contract and tests for explicit coverage.

## Integrator Notes
- Integrators should expect deterministic errors for all invalid operations.
- All public APIs are documented with Rustdoc/NatSpec comments in the contract source.
- See also: `docs/CONTRACT_FUNCTIONS.md` for cross-contract summary.

## Changelog
- 2026-03-25: Added explicit reentrancy guard tests and NatSpec documentation. This page created for integrator clarity.
