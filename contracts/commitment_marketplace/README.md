# Commitment NFT Marketplace

A comprehensive secondary market for Commitment NFTs on Soroban/Stellar, featuring fixed-price listings, offers, and auctions with secure escrow.

## Features

### 🏪 Fixed-Price Listings

- List NFTs at a fixed price

## API Reference

### Initialization

#### `initialize`

```rust
fn initialize(
    e: Env,
    admin: Address,
    nft_contract: Address,
    fee_basis_points: u32,
    fee_recipient: Address,
) -> Result<(), MarketplaceError>
```

Initialize the marketplace with admin, NFT contract address, fee structure, and fee recipient.

### Listing Management

#### `list_nft`

```rust
fn list_nft(
    e: Env,
    seller: Address,
    token_id: u32,
    price: i128,
    payment_token: Address,
) -> Result<(), MarketplaceError>
```

List an NFT for fixed-price sale.

#### `cancel_listing`

```rust
fn cancel_listing(
    e: Env,
    seller: Address,
    token_id: u32,
) -> Result<(), MarketplaceError>
```

Cancel an active listing (seller only).

#### `buy_nft`

```rust
fn buy_nft(
    e: Env,
    buyer: Address,
    token_id: u32,
) -> Result<(), MarketplaceError>
```

Purchase a listed NFT.

#### `get_listing`

```rust
fn get_listing(
    e: Env,
    token_id: u32,
) -> Result<Listing, MarketplaceError>
```

Get listing details for a specific token.

#### `get_all_listings`

```rust
fn get_all_listings(e: Env) -> Vec<Listing>
```

Get all active listings.

### Offer System

#### `make_offer`

```rust
fn make_offer(
    e: Env,
    offerer: Address,
    token_id: u32,
    amount: i128,
    payment_token: Address,
    duration: u64,
) -> Result<(), MarketplaceError>
```

Make an offer on an NFT that expires `duration` ledger seconds after creation.
The expiry boundary is exclusive: an offer is valid only while
`ledger.timestamp() < expires_at`. `duration == 0` or an overflowing
`created_at + duration` fails with `InvalidDuration`; accepting an offer at or
past `expires_at` fails with `OfferExpired`. Re-offering after expiry replaces
the stale offer; while an offer is live a duplicate fails with `OfferExists`.

#### `accept_offer`

```rust
fn accept_offer(
    e: Env,
    seller: Address,
    token_id: u32,
    offerer: Address,
) -> Result<(), MarketplaceError>
```

Accept a specific offer (seller/owner only).

#### `cancel_offer`

```rust
fn cancel_offer(
    e: Env,
    offerer: Address,
    token_id: u32,
) -> Result<(), MarketplaceError>
```

Cancel your own offer.

#### `get_offers`

```rust
fn get_offers(e: Env, token_id: u32) -> Vec<Offer>
```

Get all offers for a specific token.

### Auction System

#### `start_auction`

```rust
fn start_auction(
    e: Env,
    seller: Address,
    token_id: u32,
    starting_price: i128,
    duration_seconds: u64,
    payment_token: Address,
) -> Result<(), MarketplaceError>
```

Start a time-based auction.

#### `place_bid`

```rust
fn place_bid(
    e: Env,
    bidder: Address,
    token_id: u32,
    bid_amount: i128,
) -> Result<(), MarketplaceError>
```

Place a bid on an active auction.

#### `end_auction`

```rust
fn end_auction(e: Env, token_id: u32) -> Result<(), MarketplaceError>
```

End an auction after expiry time.

#### `get_auction`

```rust
fn get_auction(
    e: Env,
    token_id: u32,
) -> Result<Auction, MarketplaceError>
```

Get auction details.

#### `get_all_auctions`

```rust
fn get_all_auctions(e: Env) -> Vec<Auction>
```

Get all active auctions.

### Admin Functions

#### `update_fee`

```rust
fn update_fee(
    e: Env,
    fee_basis_points: u32,
) -> Result<(), MarketplaceError>
```

Update marketplace fee (admin only).

#### `get_admin`

```rust
fn get_admin(e: Env) -> Result<Address, MarketplaceError>
```

Get admin address.

#### Two-step administrator rotation

```rust
fn nominate_admin(e: Env, new_admin: Address) -> Result<(), MarketplaceError>
fn cancel_admin_transfer(e: Env) -> Result<(), MarketplaceError>
fn accept_admin_transfer(e: Env, new_admin: Address) -> Result<(), MarketplaceError>
fn get_pending_admin(e: Env) -> Option<Address>
```

Only the current administrator can nominate or cancel a handover. A nomination
replaces any previous pending nominee, while the current administrator retains
all authority until the nominated address authenticates an acceptance. Successful
nomination, cancellation, and acceptance emit `AdminNom`, `AdminCan`, and
`AdminAcc` events. A failed or replayed acceptance cannot change authority.

#### `add_payment_token` / `remove_payment_token`

```rust
fn add_payment_token(e: Env, payment_token: Address) -> Result<(), MarketplaceError>
fn remove_payment_token(e: Env, payment_token: Address) -> Result<(), MarketplaceError>
```

Manage the payment-token allowlist. Both operations require the current admin's
authorization and are idempotent. An allowlisted token is required before a
listing, offer, auction, or settlement can use it. Removing a token does not
rewrite existing listings or commitments; it prevents new use and settlement
until the token is restored. Successful changes emit `TokenAdd` or `TokenRem`
events containing the token and administrator for auditability.

## Security

### Reentrancy Protection

All state-changing functions implement:

1. Reentrancy guard check
2. State updates before external calls
3. Guard cleanup in all paths

### Access Control

- Seller-only: `cancel_listing`, `accept_offer`
- Admin-only: `update_fee`
- Offerer-only: `cancel_offer`

### Input Validation

- Price > 0
- Duration > 0
- Token existence checks
- Ownership verification

## Gas Optimization

- Batch storage operations where possible
- Efficient vector operations
- Minimal external calls
- Optimized data structures
